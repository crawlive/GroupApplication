For the outline of the notes pane copy one of the bottom anchorpanes
I couldn't figure out how to get the top part to be a diff color bc the rectangles arc height and width adjusted all 4 corners and I couldn't find a way to only do half
I'm stil working on getting the snapping in places/sizes
There is a task pane, nav pane, events pane, title pane, and notes pane, I will be adding the text boxes in my own branch and adding them later so yall can copy the base
without issue
